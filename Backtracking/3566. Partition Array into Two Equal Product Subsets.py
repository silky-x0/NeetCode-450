# You are given an integer array nums containing distinct positive integers and an integer target.
# Determine if you can partition nums into two non-empty disjoint subsets, with each element belonging to exactly one subset, such that the product of the elements in each subset is equal to target.
# Return true if such a partition exists and false otherwise.
# A subset of an array is a selection of elements of the array.
 
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [3,1,6,8,4], target = 24
# Output: true
# Explanation: The subsets [3, 8] and [1, 6, 4] each have a product of 24. Hence, the output is true.

nums = [3,1,6,8,4]
target = 24   #O/P -> True
#target = 91   O/P -> False

# first of all what i originally thought of this

# and suprisingly it passed 714/720 test casesðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I know this is dumb but okay
# now from the problem itself its obvious we can use recursion / backtracking if asked something like subset(from the tagsðŸ˜‰)
# so our main idea is to at each element we'll include it now or exclude it and store product somewhere to tarck that it doesnt exceed our target
# also for comparison and so we'll backtrack first after putting that element into subset A and then into subset B, at each step we'll update
# index, prod of A and B and also count of A and B. why? coz we dont want empty set as question said.

# In simple term, lets element 1 put into A or put into B but we cant put same element in both(disjoint set) and if index in equals to length of nums
# we'll check that if countA and B are greater than zero, and prodA equals to target equals to prod B then we return True
